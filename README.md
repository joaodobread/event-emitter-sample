# Simple Event Emitter

## Requirements

- [Deno](https://deno.com/deploy/docs)

```sh
# running
deno run main.ts
```

## Output Example

```sh
/tmp/events$ deno run main. ts
Check file:///tmp/events/main.ts
{ r: [ Promise { "okokok" }, "User created" ] }

```

### Disclaimers

- Why don't have tests?

> R: Because that implementation is just to understand how this event can work.

- Why use Deno?

> R: More easy to run TypeScript with libs with Deno.
